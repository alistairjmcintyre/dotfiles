my dotfiles for everything

GOAL:
  - keep everything the same for each system. Just adjust layout/variables on a per-system basis.

TODO:
 - i3
    - environment specific pre-defined workspaces
    - Research ENV Vars
    - Re-configure polybar etc.
    - test once.sh properly?
 - dunst
    - Using ENV vars to specify the colors would be ideal
 - rofi
    - Explore ENV Vars
    - Look at further configuration
 - polybar
    - define a 'alistairmcintyre-lp' bar from the base
    - Can I use ENV vars?
 - powerline
    - Somehow include the /usr/local/whatever shambles?
 - Xresources
    - I need more work here
 - gotop (I would like this on all my machines plz)
 - .bashrc
   Allow a per-machine include (for machine specific things, i.e for work)


laptop specific:
 - screenlayouts
 - possibly adjust the polybar contents by primary scree nsize?
 - Few apps need configuration
 - update personal-scripts work repo to also reflect other things
