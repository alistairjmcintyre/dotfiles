my dotfiles for everything

GOAL:
  - keep everything the same for each system. Just adjust layout/variables on a per-system basis.

TODO:
 - compton
 - i3
    - environment specific pre-defined workspaces
    - Can there be ENV Vars for this?
 - polybar
    - define a 'base' bar
    - define a 'desktop' bar from the base
    - define a 'laptop' bar from the base
    - Can I use ENV vars?
 - dunst
    - Should remain consistent. Possibly something needs to change based on xrandr settings
 - rofi
    - Same across all settings
 - powerline
    - Somehow include the /usr/local/whatever shambles?
 - Xresources
 - gotop (I would like this on all my machines plz)


DONE:
